## About Me

I am 22 years old and I wannt to explore this world with all my heart. Programming is one of the most interesting parts of this world for me. I am studying computer science and computer engineering at Volgograd State University.

I had experience in testing a real commercial product, in the team development of a multi-page website for psychological assistance to teenager, and also have experience in creating landing pages. At the moment, my goal is an in-depth study of javascript to improve my web development skill.
